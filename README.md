# AppBuilder AI

For this take-home assessment, I built a lightweight version of Lovable called **AppBuilder AI**, staying close to the core vision of a text-to-app experience. while also introducing original ideas to enhance user experience, interactivity, and accessibility.

The goal was to create an intuitive AI assistant that helps users build web apps through natural language commands, while also allowing live previewing, project management, and customization features.

##  What I Focused On

- **Structured Layout with Clear Separation of Concerns**
  - Left panel for AI-powered chat
  - Right panel for live app preview and code output

- **Multi-Project Architecture**
  - Users can create and toggle between multiple projects
  - Each project maintains its own independent state (chat, code, preview)

- **Persistent State Management**
  - Data is preserved even after a full page refresh
  - Each project automatically saves its state locally

- **Live Preview and Code Update Sync**
  - Every valid AI-generated HTML/JS/CSS update is reflected in the live preview
  - Preview and code are tightly coupled with the chat responses

- **Voice-to-Text Chat Input**
  - Speech recognition built using OpenAIâ€™s Whisper API
  - Seamless insertion of transcribed voice into the chat box

- **Contextual AI Chat (Anthropic Claude)**
  - Integrated Anthropic API to handle prompts and code generation
  - Chat responses are contextual, structured, and helpful

- **Interactive Chat Experience**
  - Messages are shown as assistant-style interactions
  - Conversations flow naturally while helping users build apps step-by-step

##  Features Built into AppBuilder AI

- A dedicated **chat interface** that lets users talk to the AI assistant naturally
- A **voice input button** to convert speech into chat input
- A **live preview panel** that renders the generated HTML/CSS/JS output in real time
- A **code panel** that displays the underlying code corresponding to the preview
- Full **project creation and switching system**
  - Each project has its own isolated chat and preview state
  - You can toggle between multiple projects
  - Projects persist after refresh
- **Missing features like delete, rename, or reorder** are planned as extensions
- Fully integrated panel layout with floating top bar, buttons for refresh/export, and icon grouping
- Clear visual feedback and minimalistic UI modeled after modern no-code tools


##  How It's Different from Lovable

While Lovable already supports AI chat, real-time preview updates, and text-based interactions, **AppBuilder AI introduces key usability and customization improvements**:

- It supports **multiple projects**, each with its own persistent state.
- It includes a **speech-to-text interface**, allowing hands-free interaction.
- It emphasizes **workspace-style organization** with better panel separation and inline tools.
- It lays the foundation for extended features like project history, error explanations, and future scalability, designed from a modular perspective.

##  How Iâ€™d Scale This Product Further

Here are the next steps Iâ€™d take to extend AppBuilder AI into a more production-ready experience:

- **Chat History View:** Let users browse and restore previous conversations within a project
- **Message Editing:** Add functionality to revise previous prompts or responses inline
- **Project Deletion & Renaming:** Allow users to delete or rename existing projects
- **Auth Layer with Supabase:** Add login functionality so users can persist projects across devices
- **Usage Metering:** Add token/usage tracking to prevent overuse of the Claude or Whisper APIs
- **Responsive Preview Modes:** Allow users to preview how the generated app would look on different screen sizes
- **Error Feedback & Suggestions:** Detect failed HTML rendering or bad CSS and display guided AI responses to fix it
